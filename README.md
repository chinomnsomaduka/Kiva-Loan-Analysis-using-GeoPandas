Kiva reaches some of the most remote places in the world through their global network of "Field Partners". These partners are local organizations working in communities to vet borrowers, provide services, and administer loans.

In this program, you'll investigate Kiva loans in the Philippines.  Can you identify regions that might be outside of Kiva's current network, in order to identify opportunities for recruiting new Field Partners?
